# 🔍 Logo Detection Using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based logo detection system that identifies logos in images with high accuracy. This project utilizes a CNN-VGG19 model trained to detect and classify logos, achieving an impressive 94.2% accuracy. The frontend is integrated using Django, allowing users to upload an image and get instant logo detection results.

**✨ Features:**

✅ CNN-VGG19 Model for high-accuracy logo detection

✅ 94.2% Accuracy in identifying logos

✅ User-Friendly Web Interface powered by Django

✅ Detects Genuine & Fake Logos (Only original logos generate an output)

**🔧 Technologies Used:**

Deep Learning: CNN - VGG19

Framework: Django (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Dataset: Available on Kaggle, Roboflow, and other sources

**📂 Repository Contents:**

model.py – Contains the class names of the dataset in a list

settings.py, urls.py, views.py – Django backend configuration

templates/ – Contains frontend UI for image upload and results display

**🚀 How It Works:**

1️⃣ User uploads a logo image through the web interface

2️⃣ The VGG19 model processes the image and identifies the logo

3️⃣ If the logo is genuine, the system displays the result; otherwise, no output is generated

**⚠️ Note:**

Ignore any minor errors and run the exact code to get the results

This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in brand authentication and counterfeit detection. 🚀
